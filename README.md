# African_Inflation_Forecasting
A time-series forecasting methodology for African inflation.

## Methodology:
1. We did some preprocessing on the data such as grouping the data based on the country and taking the mean to make the dataset understandable.
2. We also visualized the timeseries components susch as trends and residuals to clean the data.
3. Some tests such as Mann-Kendall and Kruskal-Wallis tests were evaluated to gain insights on the trend correlations.
4. Then, we applied Kalman-filter and PCA to eliminate the Multicorrelations between features.
5. Lastly, we implemented some models such as VAR, XGBoost, and SVM to apply forecasting.
